## ✅ Project Overview
This project showcases systematic manual testing of OpenCart v4.0, documenting 19 validated defects through Azure DevOps. Focused on e-commerce fundamentals, it evaluates critical workflows like multilingual product discovery and payment processing through 50+ test cases, highlighting my defect identification and reporting capabilities.
